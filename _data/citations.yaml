  description: We introduce the Disjunctive Refinement Layer (DRL), a novel layer
    designed to enforce the alignment of generated data with the background knowledge
    specified in user-defined constraints. DRL is the first method able to automatically
    make deep learning models inherently compliant with constraints as expressive
    as quantifier-free linear formulas, which can define non-convex and even disconnected
    spaces.

  description: 'We review deep generative modelling approaches for tabular data from
    the perspective of four types of requirements: utility of the synthetic data,
    alignment of the synthetic data with domain-specific knowledge, statistical fidelity
    of the synthetic data distribution compared to the real data distribution, and
    privacy-preserving capabilities.'

  description: We show how deep generative models for tabular data can be constrained
    such that their generated samples are guaranteed to be compliant with given constraints.
    This is achieved by automatically parsing the constraints and transforming them
    into a Constraint Layer seamlessly integrated with the model.
